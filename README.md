### Token & Nodely Roadmap
Q1-Q3 2025 Goals:

- CUR will be integrated as the main payment method for tiered premium subscriptions, making it a utility token on Solana.
- By integrating with the Pyth network, we'll ensure stable USD pricing for your subscriptions, bringing you a consistent and reliable experience.
- A portion of CUR used in subscription payments will be burned, supporting the token's long-term value and collectability.
- Introduce a staking pool program where CUR holders can earn rewards, funded by a portion of Nodely subscription purchases, to support token holders.

#### Subscription Payments
What’s Coming: CUR will be integrated as the main payment method for premium subscriptions, making it a utility token on Solana.

#### Stable Sub CUR Pricing with Pyth
What’s Coming: By integrating with the Pyth network, we'll ensure stable USD pricing for your subscriptions, bringing you a consistent and reliable experience.

#### Token Burn Mechanism
What’s Coming: A portion of CUR used in subscription payments will be burned, supporting the token's long-term value and collectability.

#### CUR Lock Staking Pools
Possibility: Introduce a staking pool program where CUR holders can earn rewards, funded by a portion of Nodely subscription purchases, to support token holders.

Stay tuned as we progress through these phases, bringing enhanced value and utility to your CUR experience. Thank you for your support and feedback as we continue to evolve!
